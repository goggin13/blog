# Firebug vs. Chrome XHR Console

I've had this conversation enough times now that I figure I should write it down.  I, like most people I know, have long since switched over to Chrome for my daily web consumption.  However, when I'm developing, I still don't think [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) can be beat.  Here are things that I love about Firebug / frustrate me when I'm using Chrome's developer tools.  

## Debugging XHR: 
This is the primary reason I can't leave Firebug.  I find Chrome's XHR debugger really unfun to use.  On Chrome XHR logging is off by default, so unless you change it in the settings you don't even see your AJAX requests in the console.  

Once (if) you've figured that out, when you click an XHR request log item in the console Chrome displays a stack trace of the AJAX call.  A stack trace!? I don't know about you, but that is just about the last thing I'm interested in when I'm examining an AJAX call.  I'm not saying it's not useful; just that it's the 1% use case not the 99% use case.  

If you click the URL in the log entry, it takes you to the network panel, where you have to click *again* to get to what I would consider the most commonly needed data, which are headers and response content. 

Contrast this with the Firebug where:  
* XHR logs are shown by default  
* First click opens to response body.  Headers are only one more click away.  
* JSON objects are formatted nicely, with different colors for keys and values.  

## Editing CSS values in the style side panels  
Both let you edit CSS on the fly <-- Awesome.  
Firebug provides autocomplete suggestions as you edit, lets you toggle through attribute options by pressing arrow keys, *and* updates it as you go (Chrome waits for you to tab away before updating).  <-- Way awesomer.  

## Editing HTML  
Similarly to CSS, both let you edit the HTML of the page you are viewing.  And also similarly to CSS, Firebug updates the page as you type, whereas Chrome waits for you to finish editing an element before rendering the change on the page.  

## Inspect Element Performance  
Okay, maybe this one is me, but I find Chrome's right-click "inspect element" option to be very spotty. It often seems to take me to the element, only to collapse the HTML tree in the console back to the root.  Firebug is spot on 99% of the time.  

## Memory Usage  
Nah I'm playing.  I don't know if it's Firefox, Firebug, or the combination, but it moves like molasses after a few hours without a restart.
