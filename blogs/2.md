# What's in my Bar?

I've always both enjoyed and been disappointed with existing apps which aim to help you organize a good bar.  I bartended my way through college, and once upon a time thought I threw a good party (long, long ago).  The problem of inputting what booze and ingredients you have and getting an output of what you can make is not a hard problem.  The solutions online are crowded with advertisements, styled for netscape navigator, and just don't seem that fun to use.

Creating a competitor seems like a good 1 day (or all night with coffee) project, and I have just that amount of time at the moment!  

Here are my goals for my party planner site:

## Goals

### Features
* All AJAX; no page reloads
* Clean interface; no distractions, just input your bar and see what you can make
* Be able to display things you can *almost* make; e.g. "you could make margaritas if you had salt", etc.
* Remember what you have in your bar for next time
* Let users create new ingredients on the fly if they need to

### Technicalities
* I enjoy the [ruby rogues podcast,](http://rubyrogues.com), and they recently discussed how and when they use the built in rails generator functions. Aside from generating migrations, I never use the generator.  But I do find myself writing repetitive code when I start a new basic model.  I plan to take this opportunity to explore generators again and see if they fit in my workflow (I'm sure they do, I just need to relearn them).  

## Results  

You can see for yourself what I threw together at [whatsinmybar.com](http://whatsinmybar.com).  While I didn't achieve all the features I wanted, I had fun and aside from the fact it's **severely** lacking in drink recipes to back up it's functionality, I think it's much nicer to use than any of the existing alternatives.  

### Nice to haves (to do when I'm bored)  
* I did not have time to implement the feature I wanted to involving displaying drinks you can almost make.  
* Find a public source of drinks to import (right now its not really useable without enough data behind it).  

### Things I learned
As I expected, the Rails generators were very helpful.  [The Rails Guide on Generators](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html) was pretty much the only resource I used, and it had ample information.  I plan to use them more in the future; if nothing else having the layouts of all the files you will need is a great time saver.  It even generates spec files, and factories (if you are using factory_girl).  Awesome.  In addition to just saving time, it's helpful to see what the Rails community agrees is idiomatic Rails code.  While the controllers and models were hardly a surprise, some of the generated rspec tests looked different than what I expected. 

In addition, I saw for the first time View and Route specs.  While I'm not sure I will often use these types of tests, as I think you cover that code pretty thoroughly if you are writing thorough request/integration specs, it can't hurt to know it's there.# What's in my Bar?
