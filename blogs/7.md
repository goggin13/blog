# Using WebMock and Jasmine CI

I find it hard to believe that more people aren't having this problem, so perhaps I was just missing the magic google incantation to summon the answers.

## My Problem  (well, one of many)  
For tests in my Rails apps, I use the [Webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) gem to stub necessary web requests.  It has a great feature where it prevents any external requests from escaping the sandbox.  

I also use the [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem) gem to facilitate writing and running Jasmine specs against my Javascript code.  It has a handy command line feature which starts a Selenium browser, runs the tests and reports success or failure; great for continuous integration environments.  

However, WebMock does not like it when the Jasmine CI scripts try to open up a browser and connect.  And the gem does not provide any hooks into it's initialization process where you can use the `Webmock.allow_net_connect!` method to tell Webmock to call off the dogs. So my task was essentially finding a way to hook myself into the Jasmine CI process in order to call `Webmock.allow_net_connect!` at the appropriate time.  Here's what I came up  with:  

## The Solution (a solution)  
Since this is ruby, and nothing is sacred I mean private, we are able to open up some of the Jasmine classes, and insert our code where we need to. Here's what I came up with:   

    # config/initializers/jasmine.rb  
    if Rails.env.test?  
      module Jasmine  
        class Server  
          def initialize_with_webmock_disabled(port = 8888, application = nil)  
            WebMock.allow_net_connect!  
            initialize_without_webmock_disabled(port, application)  
          end  
          alias_method_chain :initialize, :webmock_disabled  
        end  
      end  
    end  
  
[This](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem/blob/master/lib/jasmine/run_specs.rb) is the file the Jasmine CI file executes via RSpec in order to run it's tests.  You can see the line where the new Jasmine server is instantiated; my code monkey patches the constructor for the server object in order to call `WebMock.allow_net_connect!`.  I'm sure there were several other options of places to hook into, but this has been working so far!  Naturally this will break if/when they update the `run_specs.rb` file, but for now, I'm able to run my Jasmine tests happily.
