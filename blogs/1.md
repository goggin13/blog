# Don't expose native Backbone getters and setters

[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) has a `set` function for setting arbitrary attributes on a `Backbone.Model`.  I've taken to a convention of always wrapping this function with named setters and getters on my models. So, instead of  
`my_model.set({attribute: 'value'});`  
and  
`my_model.get('attribute');`  
I would use something like  
`my_model.setAttribute('value')`   
and   
`my_mode.getAttribute()`  

This adds some annoying boilerplate code to your model, in the form of a decent number (depending on how many attributes you have) of functions a la (in coffeescript):  
`setAttribute: (v) -> @set attribute: v`  
and  
`getAttribute: -> @get 'attribute'`  

However, I'd argue it's well worth it for the following benefits:  

* No hard to find typos:  
by which I mean, where you to mistype "attrbute" using the native Backbone syntax, you will silently get a null value back.  This can create challenging to debug errors, if you are chasing a null pointer back through the stack only to find that someone typed `model.get("atribute")` instead of `model.get("attribute")`.  Using the wrapper method, this is caught by the interpreter, as `model.getAtribute()` will throw a no such method error.  

* Should you later wish to store this attribute in a different manner, client code doesn't need to be updated.  Perhaps it's cached at the class level, or maybe computed from other attributes.  Either way, if clients are using the wrapper instead of the native backbone function, then no code outside the model needs to be updated.  

* It disguises that you are even using Backbone; should you wish to completely swap out what framework is controlling your model, all you need to do is provide analogous methods (and probably `fetch()`, `destroy()`, etc...) and your client code can continue along happily.
