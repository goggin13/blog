# asset_sync gzip_compression gotcha

Just spent far too much time debugging this, so I'm hoping to write it down now in the hopes of preventing such an occurrence again in the future.

I use the (super fantastic) [asset_sync](https://github.com/rumblelabs/asset_sync) gem to automatically sync assets from some of my rails apps up to S3.  It works great.  The default setting for gzip compression however, is false.  Since that's often an easy win for reducing the payload of your website, I naturally wanted to turn it on.  

The steps I took were to add the following line to my `production.rb` file:  
`AssetSync.config.gzip_compression == ENV['ASSET_SYNC_GZIP_COMPRESSION']`  
and then to run the following command:  
`heroku config:set ASSET_SYNC_GZIP_COMPRESSION=true --app <name_of_my_app>`  

### The problem  
Allegedly (and 99% accurately), this is all it takes to have your app start serving compressed assets out of S3.  The gotcha is **if you have already uploaded your assets to S3 it won't turn on compression for them until they change**.  The asset_sync documentation reads "If a file has a gzip compressed equivalent we will replace that asset with the compressed version and sets the correct headers for S3 to serve it."    

Which is to say at upload time, asset_sync will push up only the compressed version when it updates the assets.  So if your assets are up to date... then nothing gets pushed and your app continues to serve uncompressed assets :(.  

### The solution   
All it took to get things going were to delete the existing *.js and *.css files from my S3 bucket that I wanted to be compressed.  Then on my next push, or next `heroku run rake assets:precompile --app <my_app_name>`, asset_sync happily uploads the zipped version and were off to the (compressed) races.  Woo hoo!# asset_sync gzip_compression gotcha
