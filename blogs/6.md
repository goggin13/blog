# 5 reasons to change to CoffeeScript


Anytime I meet someone who writes Javascript, and not Coffeescript, I feel compelled to convince them to switch.  Recently I had the chance to give a talk to fellow [Cornell 3 Day Startup](http://cornell.3daystartup.org/) participants on just this subject.  I compiled a [series of samples](https://github.com/goggin13/cu_3ds_coffeescript) that I walked through in order to achieve this.  

In the interest of brevity, and hopefully rescuing more JS users in the future, I'm going to choose my 5 most favorite favoritest features of Coffeescript.  Next time I meet a JS user, I'll have these at the ready to bring them into the light.

### 1 : Functions are cleaner
Javascript:  

    greeting = function(name) {     
      if (name === null) {  
        name = "anonymous";  
      }  
      return "hello, " + name;  
    }      

Coffeescript:  

    greeting = (name="anonymous") ->   
      "hello, #{name}"  

Note:  
* FAR fewer lines and characters   
* default parameters are achieved cleanly  
* no semicolons  
* no explicit return required   

### 2 : No brackets and commas around objects  
Javascript:   

    kids = {  
      brother: {   
        name: "Max",  
        age: 11  
      },  
      sister: {  
        name: "Ida",   
        age: 9  
      }  
    }   

Coffeescript:  

    kids =  
      brother:  
        name: "Max"  
        age:  11  
      sister:  
        name: "Ida"  
        age:  9  

Again fewer characters and lines, easier to type and read, and fewer chances to anger the interpreter with omitted parenthesis or commas.

### 3 : Awesome operator aliases  
   
  launch() if ignition is on  
  
  volume = 10 if band isnt SpinalTap  
  
  letTheWildRumpusBegin() unless answer is no  
  
  if car.speed < limit then accelerate()  
  
  winner = yes if pick in [47, 92, 13]  

When I showed these to a friend who hadn't used CoffeeScript before, he said **"CoffeeScript can turn English into Javascript! I think it might be reading my mind!"**.  

Exactly.  

A few more options go a long way in readability.  The "unless" operator, a la ruby, I find especially awesome.  
  
### 4 : Classical OOP returns to JS  
   
CoffeeScript gives you familiar OOP style functionality built on top of JS's prototypical inheritance.  **Including** getting to use `super`.  Awesome.
  
    class Animal  
      constructor: (@name) ->  
  
      move: (meters) ->  
        alert @name + " moved #{meters}m."  
  
    class Snake extends Animal  
      move: ->  
        alert "Slithering..."  
        super 5  
  
    class Horse extends Animal  
      move: ->  
        alert "Galloping..."  
        super 45  
  
    sam = new Snake "Sammy the Python"  
    tom = new Horse "Tommy the Palomino"  
  
    sam.move()  
    tom.move()  
  
### 5 :  You can use start using it right away  

Since  CoffeeScript compiles into Javascript, you can start using CoffeeScript immediately in your existing Javascript apps.  You can call Javascript functions from CoffeeScript files and vice versa, use JQuery and Backbone.js etc. and plug into whatever existing asset handling you have already in place for your Javascript files. So awesome.
